# ChangeLog for schedule

*schedule-2.2:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Support nonpositive numbers in all job ranges; explain consequences

*schedule-2.1:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Fix checks for ranges

*schedule-2.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Let exec, run, wait support static jobs and static job ranges to
	  "cancel" the race condition as desired.
	- Make parallel and bg race-free, parallel waiting only for the
	  processes just started
	- Let --daemon not discard stderr (in contrast to --detach)
	- New server option -q: make server more verbose if -q is not passed
	- Improve list output
	- internal restructure of server loop

*schedule-1.1:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Introduce --bg, --daemon
	- Make the communication protocol safe concerning message length
	- Due to the previous change, strange communication bugs for some
	  commands are now fixed. For instance, when using encryption,
	  "schedule exec" was failing when looping over more than one process
	- Do not set executable bit on libraries

*schedule-1.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Strengthen encryption by using random first blocks; this should
	  greatly reduce known plaintext attacks by MITM

*schedule-0.15:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Introduce encryption: --password --passfile

*schedule-0.14:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Support CWD; introduce --nodir
	- Support HOSTTEXT (default to uname -m); introduce --nohost
	- Improve zsh completion

*schedule-0.13:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Fix zsh completion

*schedule-0.12:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Introduce --no-user --no-command to customize list output

*schedule-0.11:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Support for colored ouput (if Term::ANSIColor is available)
	- Try to set process name more appropriately

*schedule-0.10:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Add --ok, --finished, --started to start-or-queue
	- Add query commands: ok, finished, started
	- Add [user@host] to job listing
	- Fix crash in signal handling (regression from 0.8)
	- Fix crash with -l (regression from 0.8)
	- Fix interpretation/checking of job numbers/ranges in some cases
	- Use serverid so that orphant jobs cannot confuse a restarted server
	- Improve message of schedule -l if server cannot be found
	- README: First example with unqueued shutdown command

*schedule-0.9:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Introduce start-or-queue and even recommend its usage by mentioning
	  it in the main examples

*schedule-0.8:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Allow unquoted environment variables inside environment variables
	- Use library for common functions, putting connection data to a class

*schedule-0.7:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Do not allow permutation of options with arguments:
	  This simplifies passing options to commands or negative job numbers

*schedule-0.6:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Fix bug in signal handling: cancel always correct job
	- Fix exit status of some commands like "schedule run"
	- Let 0 be the last job (instead of last job + 1) for
	  certain commands (run, bg, wait, cancel, list, status)
	- Send message length for nontrivial tasks

*schedule-0.5:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Introduce SCHEDULE_OPTS and SCHEDULE_SERVER_OPTS
	- Quote newlines correctly

*schedule-0.4:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Support optionally Unix domain sockets instead of TCP sockets.
	- Improve README, giving hints about security

*schedule-0.3:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Handle timeouts

*schedule-0.2:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Startup server as nobody. Fix openrc init

*schedule-0.1:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Rebuild from scratch, based on https://github.com/vaeth/starter/
